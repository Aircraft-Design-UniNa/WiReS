Programming
=====================

WiReS folder
---------------------
Source code folder must be in OpenFOAM/user-2.3.1/ at the same level of the $FOAM_RUN directory.
Example: /home/OpenFOAM/user-2.3.1/WiReS/
Source files can have whatever kind of .cpp extension. OpenFOAM files have .C and .H extensions.

WiReS/Make
---------------------
Contains configuration for building with wmake (OpenFOAM's own compilation script based on make)
Object files are generated in a subdirectory
Executable files are generated in OpenFOAM/user-2.3.1/platforms/linux64GccDPOpt/bin/

Linking GeographicLib libraries
-----------------------------------
Add following line to ~/.bashrc file
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/user/Downloads/GeographicLib-1.46/build/src


Executing
=====================

In order for the server to access data from an OpenFOAM case

1. cd OpenFOAM/user-2.3.1/run/test_case
   This folder now contains all simulation files

2. source /opt/openfoam231/etc/bashrc

  Sources OpenFOAM version
  (also by aliasing the command in ~/.bashrc:
	alias OF231="source /opt/openfoam231/etc/bashrc ")

3. WiReS port_num
   Runs server in test_case folder and on port = port_num
   Default port_num is 1025, if nothing is specified
